                    <p>Park Ji-min (Korean: 박지민, born October 13, 1995), or simply known as Jimin, is a South Korean singer. He is a member of the music group BTS, where he serves as a vocalist and main dancer.</p>
                    <p>During middle school, Jimin was a bright student and often served as class president. In high school, he attended Busan Arts High School, majoring in modern dance and contemporary ballet. Jimin was recognized as the "top student" due to his exceptional talent in dance and impressive academic performance. Encouraged by his teacher to audition for K-pop, Jimin followed the advice and was accepted into Big Hit Entertainment. Jimin underwent less than a year of training at Big Hit Entertainment before debuting with BTS on June 13, 2013. He was the last member to join the group.</p>
                    <p>On June 13, 2013, Jimin debuted as a BTS member with the release of the single "No More Dream." As part of the group, Jimin holds the position of vocalist and dancer. Under BTS, he has released two solo tracks: "Lie" and "Serendipity." "Lie" was released in 2016 as part of the Wings album, while "Serendipity" appeared on the Love Yourself: Her album in 2017. Both songs achieved remarkable milestones, surpassing 70 million streams on Spotify, marking the first time in five years that a K-pop solo track had reached such a feat since Psy's "Gentleman".Moreover, "Lie" and "Serendipity" are the only solo songs by BTS members to rank in the UK's Official Chart Top 20. "Serendipity" also became the first solo track by a BTS member to surpass 100 million views on YouTube.</p>
