                    <p>Watanabe Haruto, better known as Haruto (Hangul: 하루토, Kana: ハルト, Kanji: 渡辺温斗; born April 5, 2004), is a Japanese singer who is active as a member of the South Korean vocal group Treasure under YG Entertainment. He first gained public attention as a trainee on YG Entertainment's survival program YG Treasure Box. He officially debuted as a group member with the lead single "Boy" in 2020. Known for his unique charisma, Haruto serves as a rapper in the group.</p>
                    <p>Haruto was born on April 5, 2004, in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, where he was raised alongside his parents and younger sister. During his childhood, his parents, who were fans of BIGBANG and 2NE1, often took him to their concerts in Japan. This inspired him to learn rap and dance from a young age. In 2017, at just 12 years old, he joined YG Entertainment as a trainee through its Japanese branch.</p>
                    <p>Alongside his fellow trainees from the Japanese branch, Haruto was introduced as part of Team J in the survival program YG Treasure Box in 2018. He captured attention with his deep and resonant voice during his performance of Rich Brian's "Dat $tick." In the fourth selection round, Haruto was included in the TREASURE 5 debut lineup alongside Bang Ye-dam, Keita, Seunghun, and Park Jeongwoo. They performed BTS's "DNA" against three other teams of five, securing second place, which resulted in the elimination of Keita and Seunghun. In the final selection, Haruto joined the Rapper Team to perform "HIT ME" by MOBB (ft. KUSH), ultimately being chosen as the first permanent member of the group and the only Japanese member of Treasure.</p>
