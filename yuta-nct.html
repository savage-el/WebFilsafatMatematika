                    <p>Yuta Nakamoto (中本悠太; born October 26, 1995), professionally known as YUTA (Korean: 유타, Japanese: ユウタ), is a Japanese singer, dancer, rapper, and actor based in South Korea. He is a member of the South Korean boy group NCT. Yuta auditioned for the SM Global Audition in Japan in 2012, passed the audition, and joined SM Rookies in 2013. Shortly after joining, he debuted with NCT 127 in 2016, becoming the first Japanese idol to debut under SM Entertainment.</p>
                    <p>Yuta was born on October 26, 1995, in Kadoma, Osaka, Japan. He is the second of three siblings, with an older sister and a younger sister. He graduated from Yashima Gakuen University International High School. Yuta played soccer from the age of five to sixteen and initially aspired to become a professional soccer player but gave up that dream to pursue a career as an idol.</p>
                    <p>Yuta became interested in an idol career in 2011 after watching TVXQ on television. Despite having no background in singing or dancing, he attended several auditions. In 2011, he participated in the "Juice Winter Collection" audition program. In 2012, he participated in SM Entertainment's first Global Audition without his parents' permission and was one of only three out of 10,000 participants to pass. At the age of 16, he joined a one-month training camp in Seoul during the summer. On December 23, 2013, he was introduced as a member of SM Rookies, SM Entertainment's pre-debut trainee team.</p>
